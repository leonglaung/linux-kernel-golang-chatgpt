# linux-kernel-golang-chatgpt
using chatgpt to translate 15 million lines of c, 79,000 files.c, and over 5,000 folders of the linux kernel from c to golang, but I didn't have that many membership accounts in hand, so I had to take my time and flip through it bit by bit.

打算用chatgpt把一千五百万行c语言，7.9万个文件，5千多个文件夹的 linux 内核，从c语言翻译成golang语言， 不过，手上没有这么多会员账号，只能慢慢来，一点一点把它翻过去。
